            "All that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combated,
            suppressed only to emerge all the powerfully, all the more
            triumphantly from the struggle."

            "Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be
            well tried before you give them your confidence. True frienship is a
            plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of
            adversity before it is entitled to appellation"

            "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the
            baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own
            interest."
